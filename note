The detachSocket() method in Dart's HttpClientResponse class is used to detach the underlying 
socket from the HTTP client. This allows you to continue using the socket even after 
the HTTP client is closed or garbage collected. This is useful in some cases where you want 
to keep the connection open for further use.

However, in the context of Dio, which is a third-party HTTP client for Dart, there's no equivalent method
to detachSocket(). Dio handles the connection lifecycle for you, including closing the connection 
when it's no longer needed.

In your code, you're using Dio to make HTTP requests. When you make a request with Dio, 
it automatically closes the connection after the request is complete. You don't need to manually 
close the connection or detach the socket.

In general, you don't need to worry about closing connections when using high-level HTTP 
clients like Dio. They handle these details for you, so you can focus on making requests 
and handling responses.
